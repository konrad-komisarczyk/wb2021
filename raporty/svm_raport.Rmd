## SVM testing
After examining 3D scatterplots for Tongji hospital, we decided that SVM might be a suitable model for that data.
As expected, SVM trained on the original Tongji hospital data has produced particullary high scoring for both accuracy and precision.
To compare, we also trained SVM on combined dataset, as well as on a dataset which excluded the Tongji hospital. The difference in shapes is best shown by ROC curves for data from Tongji hospital alone and for data excluding Tongji hospital.
