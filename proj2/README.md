# Phase 2
Comparison of neural networks and tree-based models in the clinical prediction of the course of COVID-19 illness

## Folder structure
* `DNN/` - everything neural network models related
  * `DNN/DNN.ipynb` - replication and proposal of alternate architectures
  * `DNN/comparison.ipynb` - model comparisons
* `EDA/` - dataset exploratory analysis and Boruta algorithm replication
* `book/` - things for our WB-Book Chapter
* `data/` - datasets
* `models/` - saved example models (`.h5` keras models and `.model` XGBoosts models)
* `presentation/` - presentation (PL) and figures used

## Scripts
