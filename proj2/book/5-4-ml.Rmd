### Abstract

The COVID-19 pandemic overwhelmed medical staff around the world, showing that effective and explainable models are needed to help allocate limited resources to those in need. 
Many published models for predicting COVID-19 related ICU admission and mortality were tree-based models [@yan_et_al_2020] or neural network models [@li_et_al_2020].
We compared the two architectures in effectiveness, explainability and reproducibility.
The two architectures appear to be similar with regards to their effectiveness, but the neural network model had significant reproducibility issues and worse explainability.


### Introduction

### Methods
3 neural network models and 1 xgboost model were trained for both ICU admission prediction and death prediction.
The tested neural network architectures were: 
replication of the architecture proposed by [@li_et_al_2020],
modified version of that architecture using binary cross entropy as the loss function, 
basic neural network model using two hidden layers of 32 neurons each with binary cross entropy as the loss function.
Neural network models were created using Keras Python library.
All models were trained and tested on data provided in the article [@li_et_al_2020].
Feature selection was performed as described in the article.
Data was split 0.1 test set size and 0.9 train set size.
To reduce overfitting, an internal 0.2 validation set size was used.
Effectiveness of those models were compared using receiver operating characteristic area under curve (ROC AUC) metric.
ROC AUC values were calculated using the test data held out from training.
Neural network models were trained 25 times each to compare stability.
SHAP values were calculated for the xgboost models using ???. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- wypełnić
Approximate SHAP values were calculated for neural network models using DeepExplainer from the Python SHAP library.
Feature importance was calculated using mean SHAP values and compared.



### Results
ROC curve comparison between all ICU admission models is shown in Figure 1. XGBoost model was the best-performing model, based on the ROC AUC score. The best-performing neural network model was the *Basic* model (the neural network model with only 2 layers), with a ROC AUC score of 0.696. In the mortality prediction task, however, the *Basic* neural network model outperformed all other models, as shown in Figure 2. It is worth noting that in both cases the *Article* model, which was the replication of the [@li_et_al_2020] model had the lowest ROC AUC scored, and therefore is indicated to have performed the worst.

To ensure the reliability of Neural Network models, each model was trained and tested 25 times. The resulting boxplots can be seen in Figure 3 for ICU admission prediction data and in Figure 4 for mortality data. The comparison score for both cases was ROC AUC score. As we can see in Figure 3, the *Article* model trained on ICU admission data has proven to be especially unreliable, with AUC score ranging from 0.35 up to 0.7, while other 2 models outperformed it, with both better scores and lower variances.  Figure 4 shows that models trained and tested on mortality data had overall better ROC AUC scores then their ICU admission counterparts, but some outliers can be noticed for both *Article* and *Article(crossentropy)*, reaching as low as 0.5 ROC AUC score.

### Discussion
The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated a need for quick development, testing, validation and deployment of machine learning models.
However, this can't come at the expense of reproducibility, as the replication crisis still poses a serious issue.
Our team has relatively little experience working with neural network models and it is possible that we misunderstood a part of the provided description.
In the field of machine learning both data and source code are necessary components to reproduce results.
This is even more important when proposing unusual model architectures, as those can lead to new discoveries in the field.
However, when proposing such an architecture, a baseline model should be used to demonstrate that the proposed architecture can preform better.
Finally, different external validation techniques should be used, such as a leave-one-hospital-out cross-validation or working on combined data from multiple sources.
While our team focused primarily on comparing model architectures, other chapters in the WB Book examine those aspects of fair artificial intelligence.
In conclusion, we have shown the importance of providing reproducible code, as well as having a baseline model to compare the results.
