### Abstract

The COVID-19 pandemic overwhelmed medical staff around the world, showing that effective and explainable models are needed to help allocate limited resources to those in need. 
Many published models for predicting COVID-19 related ICU admission and mortality were tree-based models [@yan_et_al_2020] or neural network models [@li_et_al_2020].
We compared the two architectures in effectiveness, explainability and reproducibility.
The two architectures appear to be similar with regards to their effectiveness, but the DNN model had significant reproducibility issues and worse explainability.
